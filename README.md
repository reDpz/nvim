# Neovim config

## Screenshot
![Preview](Pictures/preview.png)

Info:
* Font: CaskaydiaCove NFM

## Differences

* Mostly transparent
    * Transparency is disabled for neovide as it doesn't support it
* Statusline representing the mode is only character in length (idk why but I love this so much)


## Plugins (import ones)

* Bufferline
* Lualine for statusline
* Lazy as a package manager
* Tabout (allows for you to press tab to exit "" or brackets)
* vim-tmux-navigator
* nvim-tree
* telescope
* which-key
* vimwiki
* Markdown preview (start your preview with Spacebar mk or `<leader>mk`)


## Important note for windows users

Make sure to install the following with scoop:
* gcc
* fzf

## Problems

* ~~The statusline will not show up on neovide, tested on both windows and Linux~~ This has been fixed, I'm not sure what exactly fixed this either.
